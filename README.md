Foursquare API demo

Uses FourSquare API and Google Map Services v2 to search for venues in a city and display the results in a map.
Venues are displayed in a ListView and when the user clicks on a venue the map zooms to the corresponding location.
If no internet connection is available, the app searches in a local databse to retrieve the results from your last search.
